Whether you're documenting a complex debugging session or explaining architectural decisions, a well-designed platform can make the difference between information being lost or leveraged.\nThis article explores how to build a modern knowledge sharing platform using Spring Boot 3, React 18, and MySQL, with AI-powered features to enhance the authoring experience.\nThe Architecture\nOur platform follows a layered architecture:\nΓÇó Presentation Layer: React with functional components and hooks\nΓÇó Business Layer: Spring Boot services with transactional boundaries\nΓÇó Data Layer: JPA/Hibernate with MySQL for relational data\nThe separation allows independent scaling and testing of each component.\nKey Technical Decisions\nWhy Spring Boot over Node.js?\nWhile Node.js offers rapid prototyping, Spring Boot provides:\nType safety with Java 17\nRobust transaction management\nExcellent ORM support with JPA\nEnterprise-grade security features\nDatabase Design\nWe use MySQL with proper indexing on:\nForeign keys for join performance\nSearch fields (title, content) for full-text queries\nSlug fields for URL lookups\nAI Integration Strategy\nRather than bolting on AI as an afterthought, we integrated it deeply:\nWriting Assistant: Expands bullet points into prose using Gemini API\nTag Suggestions: Analyzes content to recommend relevant tags\nSmart Search: Semantic understanding of query intent\nAll AI calls proxy through our backend to protect API keys and implement retry logic.\nChallenges & Solutions\nChallenge: Rich text editor theming in dark mode\nSolution: Custom CSS overrides for CKEditor to match our slate/amber design system\nChallenge: Handling JWT refresh tokens securely\nSolution: HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens, short-lived access tokens in memory\nConclusion\nBuilding a knowledge platform is as much about user experience as it is about code. By combining Spring Boot's reliability with React's interactivity and AI's assistance, we've created a tool that makes sharing technical knowledge feel effortless.\nThe complete source code is available on GitHub - links in my profile.","status":"PUBLISHED","coverImage":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517694712202-14dd9538aa97?w=1200&auto=format&fit=crop","category":"Backend","tags":"Spring Boot, React, MySQL, Full Stack, AI Integration","summary":"Introduction In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, the ability to share knowledge efficiently has become paramount.
